Optimization algorithm and options
==================================

This chapter summarizes the optimization scheme that is used to solve
the optimization problem in :ref:`chap:problemformulation`. This includes
the basic algorithm as well as the options that can be adjusted by the
user. Note that all options as well as their corresponding default
values are listed in Table :ref:`tab:ListOfOptions`. The setting of
the options is detailed in :ref:`chap:grampcStructure` for
usage in C and Matlab.
