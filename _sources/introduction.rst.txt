Introduction
============

This manual describes the model predictive control tool GRAMPC
(gradient-based MPC - [græmp’si:]) for nonlinear
continuous-time systems subject to (possibly nonlinear) state and
control constraints. The optimization algorithm underlying GRAMPC
consists of an augmented Lagrangian scheme in connection with a tailored
gradient method. GRAMPC is implemented as C code with an additional
user interface to C++, Matlab/Simulink, and dSpace. GRAMPC
allows one to cope with (embedded) MPC problems of nonlinear and highly
dynamical systems with sampling times in the (sub)millisecond range.

The presented framework is a fundamental revision of version 1.0 of the
MPC toolbox GRAMPC :footcite:p:`Kaepernick2014` that was
originally presented for nonlinear systems with pure input constraints.
Beside “classical” nonlinear MPC, GRAMPC can be used for MPC on
shrinking horizon, general optimal control problems, moving horizon
estimation, and parameter optimization problems.

The documentation is outlined as follows. :ref:`chap:install`
describes the installation of GRAMPC for use in C and M\ atlab and
gives a brief overview on the software structure. The formulation of the
optimization problem is shown in:ref:`chap:ProblemFormulation`.
Furthermore, the chapter describes the available parameters and the
implementation of the problem as C functions.
:ref:`chap:AlgOpt` summarizes the optimization algorithm and
provides a detailed description of the available options. The usage of
GRAMPC in C and Matlab is explained in
:ref:`chap:grampcStructure`, which includes initialization,
setting of parameters and options, compiling and running as well as the
interfaces to Matlab and Simulink. :ref:`chap:Tutorials`
describes three example problems illustrating the application of
GRAMPC to model predictive control, optimal control and moving horizon
estimation. Valuable hints for tuning the software to a specific
optimization problem are given at multiple places in the documentation,
see especially the description of the options in :ref:`chap:AlgOpt`, the provided plot functions in 
:ref:`sec:Plotfunctions` and the tutorials in the last chapter.

Note that the PDF version of this documentation provides many hyperlinks
to quickly jump to the definition of parameters, options and functions.
In addition, the descriptions of parameters and options are repeated in
the :ref:`chap:Appendix`.
