This chapter presents some application examples of GRAMPC and how to
tune GRAMPC to improve the performance compared to the default
settings. In addition to a model predictive control and an optimal
control problem, a moving horizon estimation example is presented.
Please note that the plot functions, described in :ref:`sec:Plotfunctions`, and the status of GRAMPC, see :ref:`sec:AlgOpt:StatusFlags`, also provide important
information for tuning GRAMPC.
